QUICK STEPS :-

SERVER SIDE:
* CREATE "ABOOK" DATABASE ON SERVER
   PLEASE SEE EACH ISQL-SCRIPTS AT "SERVER" DIRECTORY OF THIS PROJECT

CLIENT SIDE:
* OPEN ODBC MANAGER (YOU MUST HAVE ODBC DRIVER OF YOUR DATABASE-SERVER)
  CREATE "ABOOK" ODBC DSN (DATA NAME SOURCE)

VFP PROJECT:

IF ALL STEPS ABOVE FINISHED, OPEN "ABOOK" PROJECT (.PJX) IN VFP

IF YOU CREATE ODBC DSN WHICH IS NOT NAMED "ABOOK", YOU MUST CHANGE "RM_DATA" CONNECTION TO POINT TO YOUR EXACT DSN.

IF "DATA.DBC" FAILED, TRY TO RUN "CREATEDBC.PRG" IN "DATA" DIRECTORY


* PLEASE CORRECT SOME VIEWS FOR EACH EXACT DATABASES - SEE "CREATEDBC.PRG"
